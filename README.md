# Pedestrian-Trajectory-Prediction-LSTM
Human Trajectory Prediction in Crowded Spaces using LSTM

## Overview
This repository focuses on processing and analyzing pedestrian trajectory data extracted from the well-known ETH/UCY dataset. The specific scene in the spotlight is the 'Zara' scene. Pedestrian trajectories in this dataset consist of 2D coordinates, extracted from videos recorded using overhead fixed cameras.

## Objectives
1. **Trajectory Prediction using LSTM**: Train a LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to accurately forecast pedestrian trajectories based on the given dataset.
2. **Trajectory Prediction using Encoder Decoder LSTM**: Train an Encoder-Decoder LSTM model to accurately forecast pedestrian trajectories based on the given dataset.
3. **Trajectory Generation using VAE**: Utilize a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate new pedestrian trajectories.
